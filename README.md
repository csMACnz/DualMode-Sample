# Dual-Mode Sample
Dual launchable app as a console or gui application.

Based on the discussions found on [StackOverflow]( //http://stackoverflow.com/questions/493536/can-one-executable-be-both-a-console-and-gui-application) this sample gives you the ability to launch both as a console app primarily, but also as a gui app intuitively without any compromise*.

Side Effects
------------

*You do get a flash of a console window when you launch the gui, but it is a minor detail, considering that all console usage works as expected. (With the exception of the gui launch mode, perhaps)

Other Options
-------------
Other ways of achieving this is to just have two applications, and share code between your console and your gui application.
